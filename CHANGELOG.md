## RevenueCat SDK

This release updates the SDK to use Google Play Billing Library 8. This version of the Billing Library removed APIs to query for expired subscriptions and consumed one-time products, aside from other improvements. You can check the full list of changes here: https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/release-notes#8-0-0

Additionally, we've also updated Kotlin to 2.1.10 and our new minimum version is Kotlin 2.1.0+. If you were using an older version of Kotlin, you will need to update it.

#### Play Billing Library 8: No expired subscriptions or consumed one-time products
Play Billing Library 8 removed the ability to query for expired subscriptions and consumed one-time products. This means that the RevenueCat SDK will no longer be able to send purchase information from these purchases. There are 2 cases where this can have an impact:
- If you have consumed one time purchases in Google Play that need to be restored (for example, in order to grant a lifetime entitlement). In these cases, the SDK will not be able to find these purchases and will not be able to restore them and grant the entitlements. This can especially be a problem if you're using anonymous ids and don't have your own account system. Please make sure your products are correctly configured as non-consumables in the RevenueCat dashboard to avoid consuming them in the first place if you intend to make them behave as lifetime purchases.
- (Only relevant if you recently integrated RevenueCat before upgrading to v9, and do not (yet) have all your transactions imported). The SDK will not be able to send purchase information from these expired subscriptions and consumed one time purchases to our backend, so we might miss this data in our customer profile/targeting. We can still ingest historical data from these purchases through a backend historical import. See [docs](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions). This case doesn't affect developers that have all transactions in RevenueCat, which is true for the vast majority.

#### Using the SDK with your own IAP code (previously Observer Mode)
Using the SDK with your own IAP code is still supported in v2. Other than updating the SDK version, there are no changes required. Just make sure the version of the Play Billing Library is also version 8.0.0+.

## 1.0.0-beta.3
## 1.0.0-beta.3 API Changes

This latest release updates the Android SDK dependency from v7 to [v8](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases/tag/6.0.0) to use BillingClient 7 and updates the iOS SDK dependency from v4 to v5 to use StoreKit 2 by default in the SDK.

### Migration Guides

- For a detailed guide to all of the changes, please see the [KMP V1.0.0-beta.3 Migration Guide](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-kmp/blob/main/migrations/1.0.0-beta.3-MIGRATION.md).
- See [Android Native - V8 API Migration Guide](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/blob/main/migrations/v8-MIGRATION.md) for a more thorough explanation of the Android changes.
- See [iOS Native - V5 Migration Guide](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/blob/main/Sources/DocCDocumentation/DocCDocumentation.docc/V5_API_Migration_guide.md) for a more thorough explanation of the iOS changes. Notably, this version uses StoreKit 2 to process purchases by default.

### New Minimum OS Versions

This release raises the minimum required OS versions to the following:

- iOS 13.0
- Android: SDK 21 (Android 5.0)

### In-App Purchase Key Required for StoreKit 2

In order to use StoreKit 2, you must configure your In-App Purchase Key in the RevenueCat dashboard. You can find instructions describing how to do this [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/in-app-purchase-key-configuration).
