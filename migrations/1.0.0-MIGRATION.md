# 1.0.0 Migration Guide

The RevenueCat SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform has reached v1! Here's everything you need to know if
you're coming from a previous version.

## In-App Purchase Key Required for StoreKit 2
> [!CAUTION]
> You **must** configure your [In-App Purchase Key](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration) in the RevenueCat dashboard. **Purchases will fail if the key is not configured**. This is a new requirement for all RevenueCat SDKs.

## New versioning scheme

Since purchases-kmp depends on a separate iOS framework (`PurchasesHybridCommon[UI]`) that needs to
be linked to your iOS project manually, the versioning scheme was changed to make that a bit easer.
The new versioning scheme is in the form `X+Y`, where:

* `X` is the purchases-kmp version.
* `Y` is the `PurchasesHybridCommon[UI]` version.
