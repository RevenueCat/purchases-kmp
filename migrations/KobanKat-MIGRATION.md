# KobanKat Migration Guide
The RevenueCat SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform started out as an independent project named _KobanKat_, built by [@JayShortway](https://github.com/JayShortway). Follow this migration guide if you're currently using KobanKat.

## Maven coordinates
The Maven coordinates of the SDK have changed. 

| Old groupId            | New groupId                |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `io.shortway.kobankat` | `com.revenuecat.purchases` |

| Old artifactIds     | New artifactIds          |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `kobankat-core`     | `purchases-kmp-core`     |
| `kobankat-datetime` | `purchases-kmp-datetime` |
| `kobankat-either`   | `purchases-kmp-either`   |
| `kobankat-result`   | `purchases-kmp-result`   |
| N/A                 | `purchases-kmp-ui`       |


As an example, if you were using  
```
io.shortway.kobankat:kobankat-core:<version>
```
you need to move to  
```
com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-core:<version>
```

## Linked iOS framework
The linked iOS framework has changed. This has been linked to your iOS project, e.g. in  your `Podfile`, and should be updated. If you are indeed using CocoaPods, don't forget to run `pod install --repo-update` after you made this change.

### When using Paywalls
| Old framework | New framework             |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| `RevenueCat`  | `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` |

### When not using Paywalls
| Old framework | New framework           |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `RevenueCat`  | `PurchasesHybridCommon` |

## Paywalls
The SDK now has support for Paywalls! You can use them by adding the following Maven coordinates to your depenencies: 

```
com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-ui:<version>
```

## Updated Code References
This migration guide has detailed class, property, and method changes.

### Package change
The base package of all classes has changed.

| Old package            | New package                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `io.shortway.kobankat` | `com.revenuecat.purchases.kmp` |

You can make this change using a global search & replace. In Android Studio, press CMD/Ctrl+Shift+R and enter the following:

| Search                         | Replace                                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `import io.shortway.kobankat.` | `import com.revenuecat.purchases.kmp.` |

Then press "Replace All". 

### Initialization
`PurchasesFactory` has been removed. The SDK can be configured using `Purchases.configure()`, which is the same as the RevenueCat SDKs on other platforms. It is no longer necessary to call `setApplication()` in `Application.onCreate()`. 

The `PurchasesConfiguration` class no longer has a constructor, but can be instantiated with a DSL-like approach:

```kotlin
val config = PurchasesConfiguration(apiKey = "<api-key>") {
    appUserId = "<app-user-id>"
    // More configuration options.
}
```

You can also build the configuration and pass it to `configure()` in one go, as follows:

```kotlin
Purchases.configure(apiKey = "<api-key>") {
    appUserId = "<app-user-id>"
    // More configuration options.
}
```

After this, you can access the SDK's singleton instance using `Purchases.sharedInstance`.
